<p>
Many autonomous manipulation problems, such as stacking boxes or bin-picking, require the robot to periodically reassess its trajectory and alter its planned movement in response to unforeseen changes in the environment. As a result, a manipulator robot can easily find itself in a joint configuration that is at or near a singularity, which results in a complete loss of mobility in certain directions of the task space. A significant challenge lies in generating motion plans that avoid placing the robot in or near such configurations, as this can make it impossible for the robot to adapt its movement at a later point in time. Our research is focused on ways to augment existing motion planning methods such that they generate singularity-robust trajectories, as well as novel optimization criteria which aid in improving pre-existing motion plans. Our goal is to make autonomous manipulation safer and more predictable in scenarios such as human-robot collaboration.
