  My name is Filip Marić and I am a Ph.D. student with the [STARS](www.starslab.ca) lab at the University of Toronto, directed by Prof. [Jonathan Kelly](http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/).
  I am also jointly affiliated with [LAMOR](https://lamor.fer.hr/lamor) at the University of Zagreb, directed by Prof. Ivan Petrović.

  I'm exploring how methods based on computational [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry) and [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry) geometry can be used in inverse kinematics, motion planning and control for robotic manipulators.
  Also, I am interested in how geometric representations can be used to provide domain-specific knowledge into learning methods for robotics.

  If you're interested in my work, check out the [publications](/publications) page for a list of papers and related resources. For code samples and libraries, please visit my [github](https://github.com/filipmrc) profile.
