  My name is Filip Marić and I am a Ph.D. student with the [STARS](www.starslab.ca) lab at the University of Toronto, directed by Prof. [Jonathan Kelly](http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/). 
  I am also jointly affiliated with [LAMOR](https://lamor.fer.hr/lamor) at the University of Zagreb, directed by Prof. Ivan Petrović.
  
  I'm exploring how methods based on [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry) and [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry) geometry can be used in motion planning, analysis and control for robotic manipulators.
