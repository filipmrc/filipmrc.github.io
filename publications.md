#### Riemannian Optimization for Distance Geometric Inverse Kinematics

Solving the inverse kinematics problem is a fundamental challenge in motion planning, control, and calibration for articulated robots. Kinematic models for these robots are typically param- eterized by joint angles, generating a complicated trigonometric mapping between a robot's configuration and end-effector pose. Alternatively, the kinematic model and task constraints can be represented using invariant distances between points attached to the robot. In this paper, we prove the equivalence of distance-based inverse kinematics formulations and the distance geometry problem for a large class of robots comprised of revolute joints. Unlike previous approaches, we use the connection between distance geometry and low-rank matrix completion to find inverse kinematics solutions by completing a partial Euclidean distance matrix using local optimization. Further, we parameterize the space of Euclidean distance matrices with the Riemannian manifold of fixed-rank Gram matrices, allowing us to leverage a variety of mature Riemannian optimization methods. Finally, we show that bound smoothing can be used to generate informed initializations without significant computational overhead, improving convergence. We demonstrate that our novel inverse kinematics solver achieves higher success rates compared to traditional approaches, and significantly outperforms them in many cases where multiple end-effectors are present.

#### Geometry-Aware Singularity Avoidance for Articulated Robots Using a Riemannian Metric

<div class="ui secondary segment">
Articulated robots such as manipulators are increasingly being used for tasks that involve interaction (with humans, for example), where a capacity to adapt to unexpected changes in operational space constraints is essential. 
In certain configurations, known as singularities, a manipulator loses one or more degrees of freedom (DoF) and is unable to move in certain operational space directions.
The inability to move in arbitrary directions in operational space compromises adaptivity and, potentially, safety. 
In this paper, we introduce a geometry-aware singularity index that uses a Riemannian metric to provide a measure of proximity to singular configurations and that avoids some failure modes of other common indices. 
We show that this index can be elegantly differentiated using a connection with Frećhet derivatives, making it compatible with popular local optimization approaches used for operational space control. 
Our experimental results show that a singularity avoidance method based on our index outperforms a
common manipulability maximizing method in reaching and path following tasks optimized for singularity-robust and safe motion.

#### Manipulability Maximization Using Continuous-Time Gaussian Processes
F. Marić and O. Limoyo and L. Petrović and I. Petrović and J. Kelly\
IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS’19), Macau, China
<details>

<div class="ui secondary segment">
 A significant challenge in manipulation motion planning is to ensure agility in the face of unpredictable changes during task execution. This requires the identification and possible modification of suitable joint-space trajectories, since the joint velocities required to achieve a specific end-effector motion vary with manipulator configuration. For a given manipulator configuration, the joint space-to-task space velocity mapping is characterized by a quantity known as the manipulability index. In contrast to previous control-based approaches, we examine the maximization of manipulability during planning as a way of achieving adaptable and safe joint space-to-task space motion mappings in various scenarios. By representing the manipulator trajectory as a continuous-time Gaussian process (GP), we are able to leverage recent advances in trajectory optimization to maximize the manipulability index during trajectory generation. Moreover, the sparsity of our chosen representation reduces the typically large computational cost associated with maximizing manipulability when additional constraints exist. Results from simulation studies and experiments with a real manipulator demonstrate increases in manipulability, while maintaining smooth trajectories with more dexterous (and therefore more agile) arm configurations.

  abstract = {A significant challenge in motion planning is to avoid being in or near singular configurations (singularities), that is, joint configurations that result in the loss of the ability to move in certain directions in task space. A robotic system's capacity for motion is reduced even in regions that are in close proximity to (i.e., neighbouring) a singularity. In this work we examine singularity avoidance in a motion planning context, finding trajectories which minimize proximity to singular regions, subject to constraints. We define a manipulability-based likelihood associated with singularity avoidance over a continuous trajectory representation, which we then maximize using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. Viewing the MAP problem as inference on a factor graph, we use gradient information from interpolated states to maximize the trajectory's overall manipulability. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of experimental data show increases in manipulability that result in smooth trajectories with visibly more dexterous arm configurations.},
